FOUNDATION 6 ADVANCED TEMPLATE COMPILING OPTIONS



REGULAR DEVELOPMENT CODING SESSION::
For regular development mode (like a normal coding session) ::
cd terminal
foundation watch

This builds /dist & watches it for changes

When you want to make a change to the compiling options via 
config.yml
gulpfile.babel.js
	You MUST restart 'foundation watch' for it to recognize this change

FOR EXAMPLE ::
You want to include/exclude certain Foundation JS imports as specified within config.yml, you must restart 'foundation watch' for them to take effect

CODEKIT SETTINGS
Codekit does not process any JS files by default
It causes problems when 'foundation watch' then goes to process app.js with its own imports via config.yml

TIME TO BUILD PRODUCTION SITE::
cd terminal
npm run build

-This compiles/combines/compresses/minifies all possible files within /src. Once complete, it is DONE
Does not watch for more changes
So basically only do this when you're ready to upload

THEREFORE
When coding a vanilla dev session :
cd terminal
foundation watch

When ready to create production /dist folder for upload :
cd terminal
npm run build
